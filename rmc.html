        <h3>RMC prod.</h3>
        <p>
            This used to be the website of RMC, which used to be my alias for music production, coding and everything else too.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, since I have switched to a new alias for all of my projects, this website is no longer representative. New website is: <a href="https://voxain.com">voxain.com</a>
        </p>

        <h4>Some of my old socials are still up!</h4>
        <p>
            You can still find some of the old stuff I did on the following sites <i>(Links will open in new tabs)</i>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rmc_productions" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5UcCjBjJO8npLgdOUmkEG6?si=ruWgLdSEQWiGrEkOIg1r7Q" target="_blank">Spotify</a>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <a href="mailto:info@rmcprod.me" target="_blank">info@rmcprod.me</a> <i>(Old contact email, still monitored!)</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
